## 4. EXPENSE ANALYSIS (BROKER-PRESENTED)

**No T-12 provided.** All expenses built from Expense Benchmarks v2.0, Tier 1 (5-8 units), broker-optimistic defaults. Property taxes parametrized to list price.

| # | Category | Benchmark Basis | Normalized | Per Unit | % EGI | Rationale |
|---|----------|----------------|------------|----------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | **Property Taxes** | 1.17% of price | *See matrix* | *Varies* | *Varies* | Reassessed to purchase price. Seller's current taxes: ~$21,283 on $1.707M assessed (Prop 13). Buyer will be reassessed. |
| 2 | **Insurance** | $900/unit | $6,300 | $900 | 4.7% | Broker-optimistic $800 + $100 pre-1950 adjustment. Wood frame, no fire zone, soft-story NOT required. |
| 3 | **Water / Sewer** | $500/bedroom | $5,500 | $786 | 4.1% | 11 bedrooms (studios=1 BR each). Always landlord-paid. No pool, minimal landscaping (small lot). |
| 4 | **Trash** | $400/unit | $2,800 | $400 | 2.1% | LA recycling/organic bins included. Standard for 7-unit building. |
| 5 | **Gas** | Individually metered | $0 | $0 | 0.0% | Tenant-paid. Individual meters assumed (separate unit addresses: 500, 502, 504, 506, 508, 510). |
| 6 | **Electric** | Individually metered | $0 | $0 | 0.0% | Tenant-paid. 6 individual panels/disconnects confirmed per LADBS electrical permits (2024). |
| 7 | **Common Area Electric** | Flat (Tier 1) | $1,500 | $214 | 1.1% | Minimal common area. Exterior lighting, possible hallway. No elevator, no pool, no gym. |
| 8 | **Repairs & Maintenance** | $1,300/unit | $9,100 | $1,300 | 6.8% | Base $1,200 + $150 (pre-1940 at 50% broker-optimistic adj) = $1,350. Credit -$50 for ADU/electrical CapEx (2024-2025). |
| 9 | **On-Site Manager** | N/A (Tier 1) | $0 | $0 | 0.0% | Not required: 7 units < 16-unit CA threshold. |
| 10 | **Contract Services** | Flat (Tier 1) | $1,500 | $214 | 1.1% | Broker-optimistic. Small lot (4,558 SF), minimal landscaping. Periodic common area cleaning. |
| 11 | **Administrative** | Flat (Tier 1) | $1,000 | $143 | 0.7% | Accounting, legal, bank fees, permits. Broker-optimistic for small property. |
| 12 | **Marketing** | Flat (Tier 1) | $500 | $71 | 0.4% | 100% occupied, strong rental submarket (Koreatown/E. Hollywood), organic demand. Minimal marketing needed. |
| 13 | **Management Fee** | MAX(4% EGI, $18K) | $18,000 | $2,571 | 13.4% | 4.0% of EGI = $5,359 < $18,000 minimum. Minimum binding. Note: At PF EGI, 4% = $6,350, still below $18K. Small property management economics. |
| 14 | **Reserves** | $350/unit | $2,450 | $350 | 1.8% | Pre-1940 base = $400 (broker-optimistic). Credit -$50 for recent ADU conversion + electrical upgrade. |
| 15 | **LAHD / SCEP Registration** | $43.32/unit | $303 | $43 | 0.2% | RSO property. Partially passable to tenants (not reflected as income). |

| | **Total Non-Tax Operating Expenses** | | **$49,203** | **$7,029** | **36.7%** | |

### Property Tax Schedule (Reassessed to List Price)

| List Price | Annual Tax (1.17%) | Total OpEx | OpEx/Unit | OpEx % EGI |
|-----------|-------------------|------------|-----------|------------|
| $1,175,000 | $13,748 | $62,951 | $8,993 | 47.0% |
| $1,200,000 | $14,040 | $63,243 | $9,035 | 47.2% |
| $1,225,000 | $14,333 | $63,536 | $9,076 | 47.4% |
| $1,250,000 | $14,625 | $63,828 | $9,118 | 47.6% |
| $1,275,000 | $14,918 | $64,121 | $9,160 | 47.9% |
| $1,300,000 | $15,210 | $64,413 | $9,202 | 48.1% |
| $1,325,000 | $15,503 | $64,706 | $9,244 | 48.3% |
| $1,350,000 | $15,795 | $64,998 | $9,285 | 48.5% |

## 5. NET OPERATING INCOME

### At Central Price Point ($1,275,000)

| Metric | Current (In-Place) | Pro Forma (Renovated) |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|
| EGI | $133,984 | $158,745 |
| Total OpEx | $64,121 | $64,121 |
| **NOI** | **$69,863** | **$94,624** |
| OpEx Ratio | 47.9% | 40.4% |
| OpEx per Unit | $9,160 | $9,160 |
| NOI per Unit | $9,981 | $13,518 |

**Expense Ratio Check:** 47.9% current and 40.4% pro forma are within the expected range for a Tier 1 (small building, 5-8 units) pre-war RSO property. The $18K management fee minimum disproportionately impacts small properties (represents 13.4% of EGI vs. the 4% rate). Excluding the management minimum effect, the organic expense ratio would be ~38%.

## 6. FINANCING ASSUMPTIONS

### Interest Rate Derivation (per Interest Rate Engine)

| Step | Component | Value | Source |
|------|-----------|-------|--------|
| Treasury Reference | 5-Year UST | 3.75% | Estimated from 2Y=3.437%, 10Y=4.052% (CNBC 2/17/2026). 5Y interpolated. |

## 8. ASSUMPTIONS USED

| Assumption | Value | Rationale |
|------------|-------|-----------|
| Size Tier | Tier 1 (5-8 units) | 7 units |
| Underwriting Approach | Broker-Presented | Listing-ready, broker-optimistic per underwriting_internal.md v3.0 |
| Economic Vacancy | 5.0% | Higher of actual 0% or 5% minimum (standard) |
| T-12 Available | **No** | Path B: all expenses from benchmarks |
| Management Fee Rate | 4.0% of EGI | Broker-optimistic tier rate for Tier 1 |
| Management Minimum | $18,000 | Industry standard; binding constraint for small properties |
| Reserve $/Unit | $350 | Pre-1940 base $400 − $50 recent CapEx credit |
| Tax Rate | 1.17% | LA County standard reassessment rate |
| On-Site Manager | $0 | 7 units < 16-unit CA requirement |
| Gas Metering | Individual | Separate unit addresses, typical for pre-war small building in LA |
| Electric Metering | Individual | 6 separate panels/disconnects confirmed (LADBS 2024 permits) |
| Interest Rate | 6.00% | 5Y UST (3.75%) + 225 bps spread. Conventional bank, full recourse. |
| Loan Term | 5yr fixed / 30yr amortization | Default assumption per interest rate engine |
| Max LTV | 55% | Standard for LA apartments |
| Min DSCR | 1.25x | Standard lender requirement |
| Loan Constant | 7.20% | Per rate table at 6.00%, 30yr amortization |

## 9. FLAGS & ANOMALIES

### Missing Inputs
- **T-12 Income Statement:** Not provided. All expenses derived from benchmarks. Actual expenses could differ significantly from projections. This is the primary limitation of this underwriting.
- **Utility bills:** No confirmation of metering. Individual metering assumed based on available evidence (separate addresses, LADBS electrical permits showing 6 panels). If master-metered for gas, add ~$4,200/yr ($600/unit × 7).
- **Unit SF breakdown:** Only ADU (248 SF) has confirmed SF. Building total is 4,360 SF for 7 units = ~623 SF avg. Estimated per-unit SF used in rent/SF calculations.
- **Parking count:** CofO references 0 required parking stalls for ADU. Total building parking is unclear — likely 1 garage + some street. Not separately monetized.
- **Insurance actual:** No policy provided. Benchmark used.

### Anomalies Detected
- **Management fee minimum:** At 4% of EGI, the calculated fee is only $5,359, well below the $18K industry minimum. This is a structural challenge for small buildings — management represents 13.4% of EGI (vs. 4% for larger properties). Many 5-8 unit owners self-manage, but professional management must be underwritten for all buyers.
- **Rent roll vs. pro forma survey discrepancy:** Rent roll shows $11,553.40/mo; pro forma survey shows current at $11,753/mo. ~$200/mo difference likely due to timing or AppFolio rounding. Used pro forma survey figure for consistency with rent comp analysis.
- **ADU rent premium:** Unit 510 (ADU, 248 SF) at $1,875/mo = $7.56/SF, significantly higher than the building average of ~$3.33/SF. This is at market ceiling for a micro-unit. No further upside assumed.

### Items to Verify With Seller/Owner
- [ ] Confirm gas/electric metering status for all units
- [ ] Confirm parking count and configuration
- [ ] Request actual insurance declaration page
- [ ] Request actual utility bills (12 months) if available
- [ ] Confirm laundry status — any on-site laundry income?
- [ ] Confirm ADU conversion total cost (for buyer CapEx context)
- [ ] Request T-12 if available (even partial year or prior year)

### Value-Add / Investment Thesis Notes
- **RSO Turnover Play:** 4 RSO units at $895-$1,599 (avg $1,320) vs. market $1,450-$2,200 (avg $1,838). At full turnover with classic renovation: +$26,064/yr (+18.5%).
- **Renovation CapEx Estimate:** 4 units × $18K-$25K = $72K-$100K for classic renovation at turnover.
- **Pro Forma NOI Upside:** Current NOI ~$70K → Pro Forma NOI ~$95K (+35%) at full renovation/turnover.
- **Pro Forma Cap Rate at $1,275,000:** 7.42% — very attractive for a buyer willing to execute the value-add.
- **Timeline:** RSO turnover is tenant-dependent. Conservative assumption: 1-2 units per year natural turnover = 2-4 year stabilization timeline.
