# Location Overview

**Submarket:** Koreatown / East Hollywood — 90004

---

## Neighborhood Character

500 N Alexandria Avenue occupies a prime position at the intersection of two of Los Angeles' most dynamic neighborhoods — Koreatown and East Hollywood. This area has experienced a remarkable transformation over the past decade, evolving into one of the city's most desirable rental markets driven by proximity to major employment centers, world-class dining, and unparalleled transit access. The neighborhood's dense urban fabric and walkable streetscape attract a young, professional tenant base that values convenience and lifestyle amenities. Koreatown consistently ranks among the lowest-vacancy multifamily submarkets in Los Angeles County.

## Access & Amenities

The property benefits from exceptional connectivity. The Metro B (Red) Line station at Vermont/Beverly is just 0.6 miles away, providing direct access to Hollywood, Downtown LA, and North Hollywood. Major arterials including Vermont Avenue, Western Avenue, and the 101 Freeway are all within minutes. Residents enjoy walkable access to hundreds of restaurants, cafés, and shops along Vermont and Western corridors, Wilshire Boulevard's commercial district, and cultural institutions including the Wilshire Country Club, Barnsdall Art Park, and the forthcoming Metro Purple Line extension stations that will further enhance connectivity.

## Environmental & Walkability

The property sits in a clean environmental zone — outside of flood, landslide, liquefaction, fire hazard, methane, and Alquist-Priolo earthquake fault zones per ZIMAS records. The location scores highly across walkability and transit metrics, reflecting the urban density and infrastructure that make this submarket particularly attractive to car-optional tenants. The immediate neighborhood features mature tree-lined streets with a mix of vintage apartment buildings and single-family homes, providing a quieter residential feel while remaining steps from Koreatown's vibrant commercial core.
