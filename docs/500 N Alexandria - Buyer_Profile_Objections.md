# Buyer Profile & Objections

## Target Buyer Profiles

### 1. 1031 Exchange Investor

Time-constrained exchangers seeking a stabilized asset with immediate cash flow. The 100% occupancy, diverse unit mix, and sub-$1.5M price point make this an ideal downleg replacement within a 45-day identification window. Strong financing availability supports quick close timelines.

### 2. Local Value-Add Operator

Hands-on investors targeting RSO turnover plays. With 4 below-market units and a proven renovation playbook ($18K–$25K per unit), an experienced operator can capture $26,064 in annual rent lift through natural tenant turnover — a compelling 18.5% NOI increase without displacing existing tenants.

### 3. Portfolio Consolidator

Small to mid-size multifamily investors adding an income-producing asset to an existing LA portfolio. The property's R3-1 zoning, TOC Tier 3 overlay, and Opportunity Zone designation offer long-term optionality including density bonuses for future development when market conditions warrant.

### 4. ADU-Focused Investor

Investors drawn to the recently completed ADU (CofO 2025) as proof of concept for LA's growing ADU market. The legal unit adds $22,500/yr income and demonstrates the property's ability to support additional density under current zoning.

## Objections & Rebuttals

### Objection 1: "The building is over 100 years old — won't maintenance costs be astronomical?"

While the building's pre-war vintage requires responsible stewardship, several factors mitigate maintenance risk: the electrical system was fully upgraded in 2024 (400 amps, 6 panels), the ADU was professionally constructed with a 2025 Certificate of Occupancy, and LADBS records show zero code enforcement cases. The building is NOT on the soft-story retrofit list. Pre-war construction in Los Angeles has proven remarkably durable — the original 1923 building has stood for over a century and benefits from the mild Southern California climate.

### Objection 2: "Only ~1 parking space for 7 units — won't that scare buyers and tenants?"

Parking is the most common objection in Koreatown, yet it rarely affects occupancy or rents in practice. The property has maintained 100% occupancy, and comp buildings with zero parking (212 S Berendo, 101 S Kenmore) have traded at $191K–$199K/unit — in line with or above the subject's pricing. The Walk Score of 85 and proximity to Metro B Line (0.6 mi) attract the growing population of car-optional renters. AB 2097 further reduces parking requirements for transit-adjacent development.

### Objection 3: "RSO limits my ability to increase rents."

RSO is an advantage for sellers, not a liability. Vacancy decontrol under Costa-Hawkins allows owners to reset rents to market upon natural tenant turnover. The 4 RSO tenants represent $2,172/month ($26,064/year) in embedded upside — a built-in value-add that doesn't require entitlements, approvals, or construction. Buyers consistently pay a premium for this "locked-in" upside because it represents near-certain future income growth.

### Objection 4: "Why is the price per unit lower than other recent sales?"

The $182,143/unit price reflects the property's unique position as a 7-unit building (smaller than most comps at 8–12 units) with limited parking and a mixed unit mix (studios, 2BRs, and ADU). However, this is precisely what creates the opportunity: the pro forma cap rate of 7.42% exceeds comparable closed sales, and the ADU — which adds ~$215K in capitalized value — is a premium feature not available in most vintage comp properties. Buyers who look past the headline $/unit will find superior risk-adjusted returns.
