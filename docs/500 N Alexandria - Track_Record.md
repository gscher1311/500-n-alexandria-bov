The LAAA Team is consistently ranked among the most active multifamily sales groups in Los Angeles. With a track record spanning over a decade, our team has earned the trust of hundreds of apartment owners by combining institutional-grade marketing with hands-on, relationship-driven service. We don't just list properties — we create competition.

Every assignment benefits from our proprietary marketing platform, a 30,000+ investor database, and real-time market intelligence cultivated through hundreds of transactions.

At Marcus & Millichap, the largest privately-held real estate brokerage in the nation, we leverage a platform built for one thing: connecting sellers with the most qualified, motivated buyers. Our exclusive network of 2,000+ agents nationwide ensures your property is seen by every potential investor.
