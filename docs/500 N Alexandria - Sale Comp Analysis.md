**Key Subject Characteristics for Comp Matching:**
- Pre-war vintage (1923/1929) -- among the oldest in comp set
- Small building footprint (4,360 SF on 4,558 SF lot) -- very tight site
- Mixed unit types (2BR + Studio + ADU) -- unusual hybrid mix
- ADU completed 2025 with CofO -- adds value but complicates pure comp matching
- RSO with 4 long-term tenants (1/1/1970 placeholder dates) and 3 market-rate leases
- Very limited parking (~1 space for 7 units = 0.14 ratio)
- Rent range: $895 - $2,200/mo; significant spread indicates rent upside on RSO units

*\*Comp #1 cap rate uses MLS-stated NOI of $72,925, which is internally inconsistent with reported rents and expenses. Treat as unreliable.*
*†Comps #2 and #3 cap rates are tax-adjusted (methodology below).*

### Cap Rate Recalculation Detail

**Methodology:** All cap rates recalculated from raw MLS data. Tax adjustment applied where SP < LP using LA County standard rate of 1.21%. Formula: Tax Savings = (LP - SP) × 1.21%. Adjusted NOI = Recalculated NOI + Tax Savings.

**Comp 1 -- 247 N New Hampshire Ave:**
- Rent total from unit data: $12,165/mo = $145,980/yr
- MLS stated: GOI not provided, Expense $3,216, NOI $72,925
- **DATA QUALITY FAILURE:** Expense of $3,216/yr for 12 units = $268/unit/yr -- absurdly low (benchmark: $3,500-$5,000/unit for this vintage). And $145,980 - $3,216 = $142,764, not the stated $72,925. The stated NOI implies ~$73K in vacancy/other deductions that aren't disclosed.
- Cap using stated NOI: $72,925 / $1,400,000 = **5.21% (UNRELIABLE)**
- GRM from rent: $1,400,000 / $145,980 = **9.59x**
- Concession-adjusted: Effective price $1,386,000 ($14K seller concessions). Adj $/unit = $115,500, Adj GRM = 9.49x
- Tax adjustment: SP = LP, no adjustment needed
- **Verdict: GRM is the only reliable valuation metric for this comp**

**Comp 2 -- 212 S Berendo St:**
- Actual rent: $10,077.35/mo = $120,928/yr
- Projected rent: 8 × $2,625 = $252,000/yr (108.4% upside -- massive)
- MLS stated: Expense $71,073, NOI $61,432
- Implied GOI (from stated NOI + Expense): $61,432 + $71,073 = $132,505
- GOI vs rent: $132,505 - $120,928 = $11,577 in implied other income (laundry, late fees, etc.) -- plausible but unverified
- Recalc NOI using rent only: $120,928 - $71,073 = $49,855. Cap on rent-only: $49,855 / $1,525,000 = **3.27%**
- Using MLS stated NOI: $61,432 / $1,525,000 = **4.03%**
- Tax adjustment: ($1,680,000 - $1,525,000) × 1.21% = $155,000 × 0.0121 = **$1,876**
- Adj NOI: $61,432 + $1,876 = $63,308. **Adj Cap: 4.15%**
- GRM: $1,525,000 / $120,928 = **12.61x**
- Expense ratio: $71,073 / $120,928 = **58.8%** of GSR (very high -- reflects deeply below-market RSO rents, not poor management. As rents reset to market, expense ratio would normalize to ~28% on $252K projected income)
- 1031 exchange requirement noted -- buyer motivation may have compressed pricing timeline

**Comp 3 -- 101 S Kenmore Ave (BEST DATA QUALITY):**
- GOI: $175,597 (from $14,633/mo × 12 = $175,596, confirmed)
- Expense: $60,577
- MLS stated NOI: $111,831
- **Recalc NOI: $175,597 - $60,577 = $115,020** (discrepancy of $3,189 vs stated -- likely a rounding or timing issue in MLS entry)
- MLS stated cap: 6.60% (based on their NOI of $111,831). My calc: $111,831 / $1,595,000 = 7.01%. Neither matches perfectly.
- **Using recalc NOI: $115,020 / $1,595,000 = 7.21%**
- Tax adjustment: ($1,695,000 - $1,595,000) × 1.21% = $100,000 × 0.0121 = **$1,210**
- Adj NOI: $115,020 + $1,210 = $116,230. **Adj Cap: 7.29%**
- GRM: $1,595,000 / $175,597 = **9.08x**
- Expense ratio: $60,577 / $175,597 = **34.5%** (reasonable-to-low for 1925 building; may be understated if some expenses are missing from MLS reporting)
- Projected rent: $17,600/mo = $211,200/yr (20.3% upside -- modest, healthy value-add)
- Individually metered gas + electric = lower owner expense burden
- **This is the most reliable comp in the set.** Complete financials, consistent data, arm's-length transaction, similar vintage and location.

**Comp 4 -- 143 N Commonwealth Ave (DISTRESSED / NON-ARM'S-LENGTH):**
- Rent total from unit data: $10,693/mo = $128,316/yr
- GOI: $0, Expense: $0, NOI: $0 (no financial data provided in MLS)
- **Cannot calculate cap rate** -- no income/expense data
- GRM from rents: $1,425,000 / $128,316 = **11.10x**
- SP/LP: 79.21% -- severe discount, consistent with auction/trust sale format
- **DISTRESSED FLAGS:** (1) Sale type = Auction/Trust Sale, (2) SP/LP = 79.21%, (3) Zero financial data, (4) DOM 42 for auction is meaningless
- This is NOT an arm's-length market transaction. Use only as distressed floor reference.
- Despite distressed pricing, $/unit ($237,500) and $/SF ($271.02) are the highest among sold comps -- reflects newer vintage (1951), 4 garage spaces, and larger lot (8,250 SF)

### Quality Score Notes

- **Comp 1 (New Hampshire, 4/10):** DOM 0 suggests off-market deal. Expenses of $3,216/yr for 12 units are absurd. Stated NOI doesn't reconcile with rent total. Concessions of $14K further muddy the effective price. Only GRM from rent total is usable.
- **Comp 3 (Kenmore, 9/10):** Full GOI/expense/NOI provided and largely consistent (minor $3,189 discrepancy). Arm's-length sale with reasonable DOM. Unit-level rent data available. Individual metering and laundry income noted. BEST CLOSED COMP FOR DATA.
- **Comp 4 (Commonwealth, 3/10):** Auction/trust sale with zero financial data. SP/LP of 79.21% confirms non-arm's-length. Recent (Jan 2026) is the only positive attribute. EXCLUDE from primary valuation.
- **Comp F (St Andrews, 10/10):** Complete financials, consistent data, reasonable expense ratio, ADU comp (relevant to subject's ADU). Well-described property with renovation detail.
- **Comp H (Serrano, 9/10):** Pending sale -- the market is validating this pricing. Complete and consistent financials. Copper plumbing and seismic retrofit add confidence to expense projections.

### Comparability Score Notes

- **Comp 2 (Berendo, 9/10 comparability):** Closest match -- same year built (1923), 8 units (vs 7), same zip, all 2BR/1BA (subject has 4x 2BR). Only gaps: larger building (6,680 vs 4,360 SF) and deeper RSO rent discount.
- **Comp 3 (Kenmore, 8/10 comparability):** Excellent match on vintage, unit count, location, and RSO. Weaker on unit mix (all 1BR vs subject's 2BR/Studio/ADU mix) and building size.
- **Comp A (Virgil, 8/10 comparability):** Very similar vintage (1924), close unit count (5 vs 7), same zip. Different unit mix (3BR/2BR/1BR) and much more parking (7 vs ~1). Overpriced based on DOM 133.
- **Comp F (St Andrews, 7/10 comparability):** ADU-inclusive comp -- only other property in set with ADUs (2x built 2025, same as subject's ADU timeline). 75% RSO vs 100% for subject. Significantly more expensive ($2.49M) reflecting renovations and ADU premium.

## INDIVIDUAL COMP ANALYSIS (vs. Subject)

### Sold Comp 1: 247 N New Hampshire Ave -- TERTIARY (GRM Reference Only)

**Headline:** Off-market, 12-unit studio building with unreliable financials. Use GRM as directional indicator only.

**Physical Comparison:**
- 12 units vs subject's 7 (71% more units in 78% more space)
- 1922 vintage vs 1923/1929 -- essentially identical era
- 7,736 SF on 9,544 SF lot vs 4,360 SF on 4,558 SF lot -- significantly larger on a double-sized lot
- 10 Studios + 2 1BR vs subject's 4x 2BR + 2x Studio + ADU -- fundamentally different unit mix
- 0 parking vs subject's ~1 space -- both essentially zero; neutral

**Financial Comparison:**
- In-place rents: $12,165/mo ($1,014/unit) vs subject's $11,553/mo ($1,650/unit). Subject commands 63% higher per-unit rent due to larger 2BR units.
- GRM: 9.59x (or 9.49x concession-adjusted) vs subject's TBD. This GRM is applied to a low-rent studio building.
- $/unit: $116,667 -- lowest among all sold comps. Reflects bulk studio discount (studios trade at lower $/unit than 2BR units).
- $/SF: $180.97 -- also lowest. Building is larger but rents per SF are lower.

**Adjustments to Subject:**
- Subject should trade at a PREMIUM to this comp on $/unit basis due to: (1) larger 2BR units commanding higher rents, (2) ADU with fresh CofO, (3) 100% occupancy with known tenants, (4) subject's rent/unit is 63% higher.
- Subject should trade at PARITY or slight premium on $/SF basis.
- The 9.59x GRM is a reasonable lower-bound data point for the subject's GRM range.
- **Off-market (DOM 0) pricing may not reflect true market; seller may have left money on the table.**

**Implied Subject Value (directional only):**
- At this comp's $/unit: $116,667 × 7 = $816,669 (FLOOR -- inappropriate for subject's unit mix)
- At this comp's GRM: 9.59 × $138,641 = $1,329,667
- At this comp's $/SF: $180.97 × 4,360 = $789,029 (FLOOR -- low due to studio product discount)

---

### Sold Comp 2: 212 S Berendo St -- PRIMARY (Best Unit-Mix Match)

**Headline:** Same-vintage 8-unit all-2BR/1BA RSO building with 108% rent upside. Highest comparability to subject's 2BR component. GRM inflated by deeply below-market rents.

**Physical Comparison:**
- 8 units vs 7 -- nearly identical scale
- 1923 vintage -- exact match to subject's front building
- 6,680 SF on 8,958 SF lot vs 4,360 SF on 4,558 SF lot -- 53% larger building on nearly double the lot
- All 8x 2BR/1BA -- directly comparable to subject's 4x 2BR component
- Stucco, detached, 2 stories -- similar construction
- 0 parking vs ~1 -- essentially same
- Re-roofed 2021 vs subject's 1993 roof (33 years old) -- Berendo has a meaningful advantage here

**Financial Comparison:**
- In-place rents: $10,077/mo ($1,260/unit) vs subject's $11,553/mo ($1,650/unit). Subject's per-unit rent is 31% higher, suggesting subject's tenants are closer to market.
- Berendo's 108% rent upside ($252K projected) is massive vs subject's estimated 20-40% upside.
- GRM: 12.61x -- INFLATED by deeply below-market RSO rents. At projected rents, implied GRM = $1,525,000 / $252,000 = 6.05x. Buyers paying for the upside.
- $/unit: $190,625 -- reflects the embedded value of rent upside, not current income stream.
- Adj Cap: 4.15% -- very thin on in-place income. Buyers accepted low current return for upside potential.

**Adjustments to Subject:**
- Subject's rents are closer to market (less upside), which means buyers get more current income but less growth potential. This should result in a LOWER $/unit for subject vs. this comp.
- Subject's smaller building (4,360 vs 6,680 SF) and smaller lot (4,558 vs 8,958) are negatives.
- Subject's ADU and TOC Tier 3 overlay add development optionality that Berendo lacks.
- Subject's 1993 roof vs Berendo's 2021 re-roof = ~$15K-$25K CapEx difference.
- 1031 exchange for Berendo buyer may have inflated the sale price (motivated buyer).
- **Net adjustment: Subject should trade at a 10-20% DISCOUNT to this comp on $/unit basis.**

**Implied Subject Value:**
- At this comp's $/unit: $190,625 × 7 = $1,334,375
- At 15% discount: $162,031 × 7 = $1,134,219
- At this comp's $/SF: $228.29 × 4,360 = $995,345
- At this comp's GRM: 12.61 × $138,641 = $1,748,244 (OVERSTATED -- this GRM reflects deep-value-add pricing, not comparable to subject's income profile)

---

### Sold Comp 3: 101 S Kenmore Ave -- PRIMARY (Anchor Comp / Best Data)

**Headline:** Same-vintage 8-unit 1BR building with complete, reliable financials and 20% rent upside. Best overall data quality. Anchor comp for pricing.

**Physical Comparison:**
- 8 units vs 7 -- nearly identical scale
- 1925 vintage vs 1923/1929 -- within 2-4 years; essentially identical era
- 7,806 SF on 7,201 SF lot vs 4,360 SF on 4,558 SF lot -- 79% larger building on 58% larger lot
- All 8x 1BR/1BA (~975 SF avg) vs subject's mixed 2BR/Studio/ADU -- different unit mix
- Individually metered gas + electric -- a significant operating advantage
- On-site laundry (leased) -- income that subject may not have
- 0 parking vs ~1 -- essentially same

**Financial Comparison:**
- GOI: $175,597 vs subject's $138,641 GSR (subject's GOI not fully known due to no T-12)
- In-place rent/unit: $14,633/mo / 8 = $1,829/unit vs subject's $1,650/unit -- Kenmore's 1BR units at $1,829 exceeds subject's average
- Adj Cap: 7.29% -- highest among non-distressed comps; reflects stabilized income with moderate (20%) upside
- GRM: 9.08x -- lowest GRM among sold comps, consistent with higher current-income yield
- Expense ratio: 34.5% -- reasonable for vintage building with individual metering
- $/unit: $199,375 -- highest among non-distressed sold comps

**Adjustments to Subject:**
- Subject has MIXED unit types (2BR/Studio/ADU) which is less desirable than a uniform 1BR building from a management perspective, but the 2BR units command higher rents.
- Subject is SMALLER (4,360 vs 7,806 SF). In CRE, smaller buildings trade at a $/unit DISCOUNT to larger ones (less operational efficiency).
- Subject's ADU adds a premium for buyer appeal (new CofO, modern unit).
- Kenmore's 20% upside is comparable to subject's estimated RSO upside.
- Subject's lack of individual metering (unknown) could mean higher owner expense burden.
- **Net adjustment: Subject should trade at a 5-15% DISCOUNT to this comp on $/unit basis,** reflecting smaller building size and less certain expense profile. Premium for ADU and mixed unit variety partially offsets.

**Implied Subject Value:**
- At this comp's $/unit: $199,375 × 7 = $1,395,625
- At 10% discount: $179,438 × 7 = $1,256,063
- At this comp's $/SF: $204.33 × 4,360 = $890,879
- At this comp's GRM: 9.08 × $138,641 = $1,258,860
- At this comp's adj cap (7.29%): Need subject NOI. Using 35% expense ratio estimate: NOI ≈ $138,641 × 0.65 = $90,117. At 7.29% cap: $90,117 / 0.0729 = $1,235,419

---

### Sold Comp 4: 143 N Commonwealth Ave -- EXCLUDE (Distressed / Non-Arm's-Length)

**Headline:** Auction/trust sale at 79% of list. Non-arm's-length transaction. Use ONLY as distressed floor reference.

**Physical Comparison:**
- 6 units vs 7 -- close match on count
- 1951 vintage vs 1923/1929 -- 22-28 years newer; significantly different construction era (post-war vs pre-war)
- 5,258 SF on 8,250 SF lot vs 4,360 SF on 4,558 SF lot -- similar building size, much larger lot (81% more)
- 4x 1BR + 2x 2BR vs subject's 4x 2BR + 2x Studio + ADU -- some overlap
- 4 garage spaces vs ~1 -- significant parking advantage for Commonwealth
- Separate gas & electric meters -- metering advantage

**Financial Comparison:**
- Rents: $10,693/mo ($1,782/unit avg) vs subject's $11,553/mo ($1,650/unit avg) -- surprisingly similar
- GRM: 11.10x -- but this metric is distorted by auction discount
- $/unit: $237,500 -- HIGHEST among sold comps despite distress, due to newer vintage, more parking, larger lot
- $/SF: $271.02 -- also highest; reflects 1951 construction quality premium
- No financial data (GOI, Expense, NOI all zero) -- cannot evaluate cap rate

**Distressed Indicators:**
1. Sale type explicitly marked "Auction" and "Trust Sale"
2. SP/LP ratio of 79.21% -- extreme discount (typical arm's-length: 90-100%)
3. DOM of 42 is misleading for auction format
4. Zero financial disclosure -- suggests estate/probate situation
5. Buyer likely acquired at significant discount to fair market value

**Adjustment:** This comp establishes a distressed CEILING paradox -- even at a 21% discount, it traded at $237,500/unit. At full market value (~$300K/unit based on list), it would be the most expensive comp on $/unit. This is driven by 1951 construction, 4 parking spaces, and large lot. NOT comparable to subject's pre-war profile.

**DO NOT use this comp for primary valuation of subject.**

---

### On-Market Comp A: 426 N Virgil Ave -- SECONDARY (Market Ceiling / Overpriced Reference)

**Headline:** Same-vintage 5-unit building at $319,800/unit, heavily price-reduced and lingering at 133 DOM. Establishes where the market says "no."

**Physical Comparison:**
- 5 units vs 7 -- fewer units, so $/unit is naturally higher (smaller buildings trade at premium per unit)
- 1924 vintage -- exact match to subject era
- 3,427 SF on 7,015 SF lot vs 4,360 SF on 4,558 SF lot -- smaller building, 54% larger lot
- 1x 3BR + 1x 2BR + 3x 1BR -- diverse mix (subject also has diverse mix)
- 7 parking spaces vs ~1 -- massive parking advantage (7:5 ratio vs 1:7)
- Price reduced from $1,799K to $1,599K (11.1% reduction) and still sitting at 133 DOM

**Financial Analysis:**
- Cap on LP: 5.95% -- reasonable, but market isn't biting
- GRM: 14.08x -- very high, indicates income isn't supporting the price
- Expense ratio: 16.2% ($18,406/$113,592) -- suspiciously low; likely understated to inflate NOI
- $/SF: $466.59 -- HIGHEST among all comps; suggests premium condition or overpricing

**Market Signal:** The price reduction + 133 DOM confirms the market is rejecting pricing above ~$300K/unit for small pre-war buildings in 90004, even with good parking. If this trades, expect SP/LP of 85-90%, putting it at $1,360K-$1,440K ($272K-$288K/unit). Still above subject's expected range due to parking and lot size advantages.

---

### On-Market Comp B: 121 S Oxford Ave -- TERTIARY (Sister Listing)

**Headline:** Brand-new 9-unit listing adjacent to Comp C, same seller. 1957 construction, all 1BR. Paired with Comp C for portfolio analysis.

- 9 units, 1957, all 1BR -- not comparable to subject's pre-war vintage or unit mix
- $200,000/unit and $344.17/SF at asking -- moderate pricing
- Cap on LP: 5.66%
- DOM: 1 -- too new to gauge market reception
- Adjacent to 127 S Oxford (Comp C) -- same seller appears to be liquidating both properties

**Relevance:** Limited direct comparability. The $/unit of $200K at asking provides a data point for post-war 1BR product, but subject's pre-war vintage and mixed units make direct comparison difficult.

---

### On-Market Comp C: 127 S Oxford Ave -- SECONDARY (Fresh Market Data)

**Headline:** Brand-new 8-unit listing with consistent financials. 1953 vintage, all 1BR, 0 parking. Good data quality, moderate comparability.

- 8 units vs 7 -- close
- 1953 vs 1923/1929 -- 24-30 years newer
- 4,480 SF vs 4,360 SF -- nearly identical building size
- 0 parking -- same as subject (essentially)
- Cap on LP: 5.51%, GRM: 12.34x
- Expense ratio: 31.9% -- reasonable
- $225,000/unit at asking; if trades at 90-95%, implied $202K-$214K/unit

**Relevance:** Building size is closest match to subject among all on-market comps. Pricing suggests the market is asking $200-225K/unit for 1950s 8-unit RSO buildings in 90004. Pre-war subject should trade at a discount on $/unit (older construction) but may command similar $/SF.

---

### On-Market Comp D: 543 N Ardmore Ave -- TERTIARY (Too Large, Data Issues)

**Headline:** 12-unit mixed building with new roof and seismic retrofit. Data errors undermine confidence. Too large for direct comparison.

- 12 units vs 7 -- 71% larger
- 1958 vs 1923/1929 -- much newer
- 9,320 SF on 11,035 SF lot -- more than double subject's footprint
- 12 parking (12:12 ratio) vs ~1 (1:7 ratio) -- massive parking advantage
- MLS expense of "$900,188" is a clear data entry error (likely $90,019 or $92,761)
- NOI discrepancy: stated $104,781 vs calculated $109,690

**Relevance:** The $191,667/unit at asking provides a data point for larger 1950s product with good parking. New roof (2025) and seismic retrofit are significant capex-complete advantages. Subject would trade at a significant discount due to smaller scale, older vintage, and near-zero parking.

---

### On-Market Comp E: 635 N Beachwood Dr -- TERTIARY (Hancock Park Premium)

**Headline:** Hancock Park location commands outsized premium. $392,500/unit and $491.75/SF reflect submarket, not building quality. Not comparable.

- Hancock Park is a premium submarket with significantly higher property values than Wilshire Center/East Hollywood
- $392,500/unit is 65-85% above the non-distressed sold comp average -- nearly all of the premium is location-driven
- Expense ratio of 13.5% is unrealistically low -- likely understated
- 1 vacant unit (Unit 6 at $0 rent) inflates scheduled GOI over actual

**Relevance:** EXCLUDE from subject pricing. The Hancock Park premium makes direct comparison meaningless. Useful only as ceiling reference for 90004 zip code.

---

### On-Market Comp F: 310 N St Andrews Pl -- SECONDARY (ADU Comp)

**Headline:** 8-unit building (6 main + 2 ADU built 2025) with extensive renovations. Most relevant ADU comp in the set. Premium pricing reflects value-add completion.

**Physical Comparison:**
- 8 units (6 + 2 ADU) vs 7 (6 + 1 ADU) -- extremely similar structure
- 1941 (main) + 2025 (ADUs) vs 1923/1929 (main) + 2025 (ADU) -- subject is 18 years older
- 6,216 SF vs 4,360 SF -- 43% larger
- 2 buildings vs 2 buildings -- same configuration
- 75% RSO vs ~57% RSO (subject: 4 RSO + 3 market-rate) -- similar rent control exposure
- 7 parking (4+ car garage) vs ~1 -- significant advantage
- Copper plumbing, updated kitchens/baths in 5/6 main units, split AC/heat -- significantly better condition than subject

**Financial Comparison:**
- GOI: $181,539 vs subject's $138,641 -- St Andrews generates 31% more income
- Cap on LP: 5.06%, GRM: 13.72x
- $/unit: $311,250 at asking -- reflects completed renovations and ADU premium
- $/SF: $400.58 -- high but justified by condition

**ADU Value Insight:**
- St Andrews has 2 ADUs (each 375 SF, built 2025) at market rent
- Subject has 1 ADU (248-272 SF, CofO 7/2025) at $1,875/mo
- The ADU premium on St Andrews: If we attribute ~$50K-$75K per ADU, that accounts for $100K-$150K of the price differential vs. a comparable non-ADU building
- Subject's single ADU may add $50K-$75K to its value vs. a comparable non-ADU property

**Adjustment:** Subject should trade at a 35-45% DISCOUNT to this comp on $/unit basis, reflecting: (1) older vintage, (2) less parking, (3) fewer renovations, (4) only 1 ADU vs 2, (5) smaller building. St Andrews represents what subject COULD be worth after significant renovation and a second ADU addition.

---

### On-Market Comp G: 4053 Oakwood Ave -- EXCLUDE (Stale Listing)

**Headline:** 285 DOM with price reduction from $2.8M to $2.6M. Market has clearly rejected this pricing. Expense data error. Stale.

- Listed since May 2025 -- almost 10 months on market
- Price reduced 7.1% and still not trading
- MLS expense of "$900,188" is identical data error seen in Comp D (may be an MLS system bug affecting both listings)
- 12 units, 1963, 10,371 SF -- much larger and newer than subject
- $/unit $216,667 at current ask, but expect further reduction or withdrawal

**Relevance:** EXCLUDE from primary analysis. The extended DOM confirms 90004 market resistance at these per-unit prices for larger mid-century product. If it trades, expect significant further discount.

---

### Pending Comp H: 502 N Serrano Ave -- SECONDARY (Market Validation)

**Headline:** 8-unit pending sale with excellent financial data, copper plumbing, and seismic retrofit. CBRE-listed. Pending status validates pricing around $224K/unit for renovated 1950s product.

**Physical Comparison:**
- 8 units vs 7 -- close
- 1956 vs 1923/1929 -- 27-33 years newer; different construction era
- 7,456 SF on 7,553 SF lot vs 4,360 SF on 4,558 SF lot -- 71% larger building on 66% larger lot
- 6x 1BR + 2x 2BR vs 4x 2BR + 2x Studio + ADU -- some unit mix overlap
- 9 parking (9:8 ratio) vs ~1 (1:7 ratio) -- massive parking advantage
- Full copper plumbing + soft-story retrofit 2019 -- significant infrastructure advantages
- CBRE listing with dedicated website (502serrano.com)

**Financial Comparison:**
- GOI: $163,587 vs subject's $138,641 -- Serrano generates 18% more income
- Cap on LP: 5.57%, GRM: 10.97x
- Expense ratio: 38.9% -- reasonable and believable for 1956 building
- ~20% NOI upside + RUBS potential noted
- $/unit: $224,375, $/SF: $240.75

**Market Signal:** Went pending after 145 DOM. The long marketing period suggests this traded BELOW list -- estimate $1,600K-$1,700K range ($200K-$213K/unit), consistent with sold comp #3 Kenmore pricing. When this closes, it will become one of the strongest comps in the set.

**Adjustment:** Subject should trade at a 20-30% DISCOUNT to this comp's asking, reflecting: (1) older vintage (pre-war vs post-war), (2) far less parking, (3) no copper plumbing or seismic retrofit, (4) smaller building. If Serrano closes at ~$1,650K ($206K/unit), subject's comp-adjusted value from this data point would be $144K-$165K/unit = $1,010K-$1,155K.

## MARKET SEGMENTATION ANALYSIS

### Segment 1: Pre-War Vintage (Built Before 1945)

| Comp | Address | Units | Year | $/Unit | $/SF | GRM | Cap | Status |
|------|---------|-------|------|--------|------|-----|-----|--------|
| 1 | 247 N New Hampshire | 12 | 1922 | $116,667 | $180.97 | 9.59 | 5.21%* | Sold |
| 2 | 212 S Berendo | 8 | 1923 | $190,625 | $228.29 | 12.61 | 4.15% | Sold |
| 3 | 101 S Kenmore | 8 | 1925 | $199,375 | $204.33 | 9.08 | 7.29% | Sold |
| A | 426 N Virgil | 5 | 1924 | $319,800 | $466.59 | 14.08 | 5.95% | Active |
| F | 310 N St Andrews | 8 | 1941 | $311,250 | $400.58 | 13.72 | 5.06% | Active |

**Subject (500 N Alexandria):** 7 units, 1923/1929, RSO, 4,360 SF

**Pre-War Segment Summary (Sold Only):**

| Metric | Average | Median | Range |
|--------|---------|--------|-------|
| $/Unit | $168,889 | $190,625 | $116,667 - $199,375 |
| $/SF | $204.53 | $204.33 | $180.97 - $228.29 |
| GRM | 10.43x | 9.59x | 9.08x - 12.61x |

**Key Insight:** Pre-war product in 90004 is trading at $117K-$199K/unit for sold comps. On-market pre-war is priced at $310K-$320K/unit, but both are lingering (133-285 DOM for Virgil / St Andrews). Market clearance for pre-war appears to be in the $165K-$200K/unit range. Subject should target the $155K-$190K/unit range given its smaller size and limited parking, with the ADU providing some upside differentiation.

### Segment 2: Post-War / Mid-Century (Built 1945-1965)

| Comp | Address | Units | Year | $/Unit | $/SF | GRM | Cap | Status |
|------|---------|-------|------|--------|------|-----|-----|--------|
| 4 | 143 N Commonwealth | 6 | 1951 | $237,500 | $271.02 | 11.10 | N/A | Sold (DISTRESSED) |
| B | 121 S Oxford | 9 | 1957 | $200,000 | $344.17 | 13.73 | 5.66% | Active |
| C | 127 S Oxford | 8 | 1953 | $225,000 | $401.79 | 12.34 | 5.51% | Active |
| D | 543 N Ardmore | 12 | 1958 | $191,667 | $246.78 | 11.36 | 4.77% | Active |
| E | 635 N Beachwood | 6 | 1955 | $392,500 | $491.75 | 14.17 | 6.10% | Active |
| G | 4053 Oakwood | 12 | 1963 | $216,667 | $250.70 | 10.47 | 5.83% | Active |
| H | 502 N Serrano | 8 | 1956 | $224,375 | $240.75 | 10.97 | 5.57% | Pending |

**Post-War Segment Summary (excl. distressed #4 and premium #E):**

| Metric | Average | Median | Range |
|--------|---------|--------|-------|
| $/Unit (asking) | $211,542 | $212,334 | $191,667 - $225,000 |
| $/SF (asking) | $296.70 | $248.74 | $240.75 - $401.79 |
| Cap Rate (on LP) | 5.47% | 5.57% | 4.77% - 5.83% |
| GRM | 11.77x | 11.36x | 10.47x - 13.73x |

**Key Insight:** Post-war product is asking $192K-$225K/unit (excluding Beachwood premium). The pending Serrano deal at $224K/unit validates upper end of this range. Post-war buildings command a premium over pre-war ($212K vs $169K average $/unit) due to better construction, more parking, and lower deferred maintenance risk. Subject's pre-war vintage places it firmly below the post-war range.

### Segment 3: Small Buildings (5-8 Units) -- Most Comparable to Subject

| Comp | Address | Units | Year | $/Unit | $/SF | GRM | Cap | Status |
|------|---------|-------|------|--------|------|-----|-----|--------|
| 2 | 212 S Berendo | 8 | 1923 | $190,625 | $228.29 | 12.61 | 4.15% | Sold |
| 3 | 101 S Kenmore | 8 | 1925 | $199,375 | $204.33 | 9.08 | 7.29% | Sold |
| 4 | 143 N Commonwealth | 6 | 1951 | $237,500 | $271.02 | 11.10 | N/A | Sold (DIST) |
| A | 426 N Virgil | 5 | 1924 | $319,800 | $466.59 | 14.08 | 5.95% | Active |
| C | 127 S Oxford | 8 | 1953 | $225,000 | $401.79 | 12.34 | 5.51% | Active |
| E | 635 N Beachwood | 6 | 1955 | $392,500 | $491.75 | 14.17 | 6.10% | Active |
| F | 310 N St Andrews | 8 | 1941 | $311,250 | $400.58 | 13.72 | 5.06% | Active |
| H | 502 N Serrano | 8 | 1956 | $224,375 | $240.75 | 10.97 | 5.57% | Pending |

**Small Building Summary (Sold, excl. distressed):**

| Metric | Average | Median | Range |
|--------|---------|--------|-------|
| $/Unit | $195,000 | $195,000 | $190,625 - $199,375 |
| $/SF | $216.31 | $216.31 | $204.33 - $228.29 |
| GRM | 10.85x | 10.85x | 9.08x - 12.61x |

**Key Insight:** Small (5-8 unit) sold buildings in the area cluster around $190K-$200K/unit with GRM of 9-13x. This is the most relevant segment for the subject. Active listings for small buildings range from $225K-$392K/unit, but these represent asking prices with expected 5-15% negotiation discounts. Subject's 7 units fit squarely in this segment.

## PARKING ANALYSIS

| Comp | Units | Parking | Ratio | $/Unit | Status |
|------|-------|---------|-------|--------|--------|
| 1 | 12 | 0 | 0.00 | $116,667 | Sold |
| 2 | 8 | 0 | 0.00 | $190,625 | Sold |
| 3 | 8 | 0 | 0.00 | $199,375 | Sold |
| 4 | 6 | 4 | 0.67 | $237,500 | Sold (dist.) |
| A | 5 | 7 | 1.40 | $319,800 | Active |
| C | 8 | 0 | 0.00 | $225,000 | Active |
| D | 12 | 12 | 1.00 | $191,667 | Active |
| F | 8 | 7 | 0.88 | $311,250 | Active |
| H | 8 | 9 | 1.13 | $224,375 | Pending |
| **Subj** | **7** | **~1** | **0.14** | **TBD** | -- |

**Observation:** Among non-distressed sold comps, all three have 0 parking spaces, trading at $117K-$199K/unit. Subject's ~1 space is marginally better but functionally equivalent. Parking does not appear to be a differentiator among the sold comp set, but the on-market comps with higher parking ratios (Virgil 1.4:1, St Andrews 0.88:1, Serrano 1.13:1) are priced at significant premiums ($224K-$320K/unit). This suggests parking IS valued by buyers at the listing stage, but the market clearing price for zero-parking buildings is lower.

**Subject Impact:** Subject's near-zero parking is consistent with the sold comp set and should not be penalized relative to comps #1-3. It IS a disadvantage vs. on-market comps F, H, and A.

## RENT UPSIDE ANALYSIS

| Comp | In-Place Rent/Yr | Projected Rent/Yr | Upside % | $/Unit | Status |
|------|-----------------|-------------------|----------|--------|--------|
| 2 | $120,928 | $252,000 | 108.4% | $190,625 | Sold |
| 3 | $175,597 | $211,200 | 20.3% | $199,375 | Sold |
| 4 | $128,316 | N/A | N/A | $237,500 | Sold (dist.) |
| G | $248,419 | ~$310K (est) | ~25% | $216,667 | Active |
| H | $163,587 | ~$196K (est) | ~20% | $224,375 | Pending |
| **Subj** | **$138,641** | **~$170K-$185K (est)** | **~22-33%** | **TBD** | -- |

**Subject Rent Upside Estimate:**
- RSO units (4 tenants): $1,290 + $1,599 + $1,494 + $895 = $5,278/mo. At market: ~$2,200-$2,400 (2BR), ~$1,500-$1,600 (Studio) = ~$8,200-$8,400/mo. Upside: $2,922-$3,122/mo = $35K-$37.5K/yr
- Market-rate units (3 tenants): $2,200 + $2,200 + $1,875 = $6,275/mo. Already at or near market.
- Total projected: ~$14,475-$14,675/mo = $173,700-$176,100/yr
- **Upside: 25-27%** -- moderate, consistent with comps #3 and H

**Key Insight:** Comps with higher rent upside (>50%) trade at higher GRMs because buyers are paying for future income. The subject's moderate upside (25-27%) means it should trade at a GRM closer to Kenmore (9.08x) than Berendo (12.61x). Expected GRM range for subject: **9.0x - 10.5x**.

## EXPENSE RATIO BENCHMARKING

| Comp | Expense | GOI | Ratio | Units | Year | Reliability |
|------|---------|-----|-------|-------|------|------------|
| 1 | $3,216 | $145,980 | 2.2% | 12 | 1922 | UNRELIABLE (absurdly low) |
| 2 | $71,073 | $120,928* | 58.8% | 8 | 1923 | Distorted by below-market rents |
| 3 | $60,577 | $175,597 | 34.5% | 8 | 1925 | RELIABLE (may be slightly low) |
| A | $18,406 | $113,592 | 16.2% | 5 | 1924 | SUSPICIOUS (likely understated) |
| C | $46,593 | $145,834 | 31.9% | 8 | 1953 | Reasonable |
| D | $92,761 | $202,451 | 45.8% | 12 | 1958 | Reasonable (if expense is correct) |
| E | $22,515 | $166,224 | 13.5% | 6 | 1955 | SUSPICIOUS (likely understated) |
| F | $55,540 | $181,539 | 30.6% | 8 | 1941 | Reasonable |
| H | $63,614 | $163,587 | 38.9% | 8 | 1956 | RELIABLE |

*\*Comp 2 expense ratio uses GSR since GOI includes unverified "other income"*

**Reliable Expense Ratio Range (Comps 3, C, F, H):** 30.6% - 38.9%, Average: 33.7%
**Benchmark for Subject:** 35-40% (conservative, reflecting pre-war vintage with unknown plumbing/electrical condition and 1993 roof nearing end of life)

**Subject Estimated Expenses:**
- At 35%: $138,641 × 0.35 = $48,524
- At 40%: $138,641 × 0.40 = $55,456
- Known: Property taxes $21,283 (38-44% of estimated total expenses alone -- this leaves only $27K-$34K for insurance, maintenance, management, reserves, utilities, and other operating costs)

## BEST & WEAKEST COMP RANKINGS

### Best Comps (Ranked)

1. **101 S Kenmore Ave (Sold #3)** -- Quality 9, Comparability 8, Combined 17. Complete financials, arm's-length, same vintage, same zip. Anchor comp.
2. **212 S Berendo St (Sold #2)** -- Quality 6, Comparability 9, Combined 15. Best unit-mix match (2BR), same year built. Lower data quality (inconsistent NOI). Strong directional comp.
3. **502 N Serrano Ave (Pending H)** -- Quality 9, Comparability 6, Combined 15. Pending sale validates market. Post-war vintage is a mismatch, but excellent financial data provides benchmarking value.
4. **310 N St Andrews Pl (Active F)** -- Quality 10, Comparability 7, Combined 17. Only ADU comp in set. Premium pricing reflects completed renovations -- serves as "renovated ceiling" for subject.

### Weakest Comps (Ranked from worst)

1. **143 N Commonwealth (Sold #4)** -- Distressed auction/trust sale. Non-arm's-length. No financial data. EXCLUDE.
2. **4053 Oakwood (Active G)** -- 285 DOM, price reduced, expense data error. Market-rejected and stale. EXCLUDE.
3. **635 N Beachwood (Active E)** -- Hancock Park premium location makes it non-comparable on pricing. Use only as submarket ceiling reference.
4. **247 N New Hampshire (Sold #1)** -- Unreliable financials, off-market (DOM 0), studio product. Use GRM only.

## KEY FINDINGS & MARKET INSIGHTS

### 1. Pricing Corridors for Subject

Based on the comp analysis, the subject (500 N Alexandria) should be valued within these ranges:

| Method | Low | Mid | High | Basis |
|--------|-----|-----|------|-------|
| $/Unit | $155,000 | $175,000 | $195,000 | Non-distressed sold avg $169K adj for subject's smaller size |
| × 7 units | **$1,085,000** | **$1,225,000** | **$1,365,000** | |
| $/SF | $185 | $205 | $225 | Sold comp range $181-$228, subject in lower-mid range |
| × 4,360 SF | **$806,600** | **$893,800** | **$981,000** | |
| GRM | 9.0x | 9.5x | 10.5x | Subject income is moderate upside (25-27%), similar to Kenmore |
| × $138,641 GSR | **$1,247,769** | **$1,317,090** | **$1,455,731** | |
| Cap Rate | 7.25% | 6.25% | 5.25% | Using est. NOI of $83K-$90K, adjusted for subject risk profile |
| Est. NOI ~$87K | **$1,200,000** | **$1,392,000** | **$1,657,143** | |

**Synthesis Range: $1,100,000 - $1,400,000**
**Central Tendency: $1,200,000 - $1,300,000**
**Implied $/Unit: $171,429 - $185,714**
**Implied GRM: 8.7x - 9.4x**

### 2. SP/LP Ratio Trend

- Non-distressed sold comps: 90.77% - 100%, avg **94.96%**
- Distressed: 79.21% (outlier)
- On-market with long DOM (A, G): likely to close at 85-90% of current ask
- Fresh listings (B, C): may achieve 93-97% of ask

**Implication:** If listing the subject, expect to sell at 90-95% of list price. Price accordingly.

### 3. DOM Trend

- Non-distressed sold comps: 0-19 days (avg 13, but Comp 1 DOM 0 distorts)
- Removing Comp 1: average DOM for sold comps is 19 days (both #2 and #3 at 19 DOM)
- On-market comps with extended DOM (133-285): clearly overpriced
- On-market with moderate DOM (12-42): still testing market
- Pending comp (H): 145 DOM before going pending -- suggests the market is slow but deals are happening

**Implication:** Properly priced small multifamily in 90004 is closing in 15-45 days. Overpriced product sits for 100+ days before price reductions.

### 4. Market Condition Indicators

- **Supply:** 7 active + 1 pending in 90004 zip for 5-12 unit multifamily. Relatively active supply.
- **Demand:** Sold comps took 0-42 DOM (19 avg excl outliers). Moderate demand at market-clearing prices.
- **Price Direction:** Two sold comps from Aug 2025 and one from Jul 2025 anchor the closed market. One Jan 2026 sale was distressed. No evidence of price appreciation or decline in the 6-month period -- flat market.
- **Buyer Profile:** 1031 exchange buyers (Berendo), value-add investors (Kenmore), opportunistic buyers (Commonwealth auction). The market is dominated by investors seeking RSO buildings with rent upside.
- **Financing Environment:** Debt assumption (rare but occurs), cash/exchange buyers appear active. Higher rates are suppressing leveraged buyer participation and keeping cap rates elevated.

### 5. Subject-Specific Risk Factors

| Risk | Impact | Mitigant |
|------|--------|---------|
| 1993 roof (33 years old) | Buyers will deduct $15K-$30K for replacement | Disclose proactively; adjust list price |
| Unknown plumbing (100+ yr old) | If original galvanized, deduction of $30K-$50K | Obtain inspection report pre-listing |
| Very limited parking (~1:7) | Buyer resistance for family-sized 2BR units | Consistent with sold comps (all have 0-1 parking) |
| Small lot (4,558 SF) | Limits expansion/development upside | TOC Tier 3 overlay still provides density bonus rights |
| Mixed unit types | Some investors prefer uniform buildings | ADU adds value; diverse rent streams reduce risk |
| 4 RSO tenants with very long tenure | Limits near-term rent reset ability | ~25-27% upside is still attractive |
| No T-12 provided | Buyer due diligence concern | Prepare T-12 equivalent before marketing |
| ADU (new, 248-272 SF) | Very small; may not appeal to all tenants | Rented at $1,875/mo; clearly absorbed by market |

### 6. ADU Value Contribution

The subject's ADU (completed 2025, 248-272 SF, rented at $1,875/mo = $22,500/yr) is unusual for the comp set:

- **Only other ADU comp:** 310 N St Andrews (2 ADUs, 375 SF each, 2025). Listed at $311,250/unit.
- **ADU income contribution:** $22,500 / $138,641 = 16.2% of total GSR from 14.3% of units (1/7)
- **Estimated ADU value add:** At 9-10x GRM on ADU income: $202,500 - $225,000 value attributable to ADU
- **Per remaining 6 units:** If ADU adds ~$215K and total value is ~$1,250K, the 6 non-ADU units are valued at ~$1,035K / 6 = $172,500/unit -- consistent with non-ADU comp pricing

## DATA QUALITY FLAGS SUMMARY

| Flag | Comp(s) | Issue | Resolution |
|------|---------|-------|------------|
| CRITICAL | Sold #1 (247 NH) | Expense $3,216/yr for 12 units; NOI doesn't reconcile | Use GRM only; exclude from cap rate analysis |
| CRITICAL | Sold #4 (143 Commonwealth) | Auction/trust sale; SP/LP 79.21%; zero financials | Flag as distressed; exclude from primary valuation |
| WARNING | Active D (543 Ardmore) | MLS expense "$900,188" -- data entry error | Use recalculated NOI ($109,690) |
| WARNING | Active G (4053 Oakwood) | Same "$900,188" expense error; 285 DOM | Use stated NOI ($151,535) with caution; deprioritize due to staleness |
| WARNING | Active E (635 Beachwood) | Expense ratio 13.5% -- unrealistically low | Likely understated; do not trust as expense benchmark |
| WARNING | Active A (426 Virgil) | Expense ratio 16.2% -- suspiciously low | Likely understated; NOI may be inflated |
| INFO | Sold #2 (212 Berendo) | 1031 exchange -- buyer motivation may inflate price | Note in adjustment; slight downward weight |
| INFO | Sold #3 (101 Kenmore) | Stated NOI ($111,831) vs recalculated ($115,020) -- $3,189 gap | Use recalculated; minor discrepancy |
| INFO | Active B, C (Oxford pair) | Adjacent properties, same seller -- potential portfolio discount | Monitor; if sold together, pricing may differ from individual sales |
| INFO | Pending H (502 Serrano) | Pending at $1,795K after 145 DOM; likely closing below ask | Monitor for closed price; will become top comp when recorded |

## METHODOLOGY NOTES

1. **Tax Adjustment Formula:** Tax Savings = (List Price - Sale Price) × 1.21% (LA County standard effective rate). Applied only where SP < LP. This reflects the property tax savings a buyer realizes by purchasing below the listed/assessed baseline, added to NOI for a tax-adjusted cap rate.

2. **GRM Calculation:** Sale Price (or List Price for active) ÷ Annual Gross Scheduled Rent. Used in-place actual rents where available, GOI where actual rents not disclosed. GRM is stated explicitly when using GOI vs. rent to avoid conflating the two.

3. **Cap Rate Calculation:** NOI ÷ Sale Price (or List Price for active). All NOIs recalculated from GOI - Expenses where data permits. MLS-stated cap rates are presented for reference but NOT relied upon.

4. **Expense Ratio Benchmark:** Reliable comps (#3, C, F, H) produce a range of 30.6% - 38.9%. Applied 35-40% to subject as conservative estimate. Subject's property taxes ($21,283) represent 38-44% of estimated total expenses, leaving limited budget for other operating costs -- reinforcing the need for a T-12 or detailed expense build-up before formal underwriting.

5. **Arm's-Length Filter:** Comp #4 (143 N Commonwealth) excluded from primary valuation due to auction/trust sale format and 79.21% SP/LP ratio. Comp #1 (247 N New Hampshire) retained with heavy caveats (off-market, unreliable financials).

6. **Concession Adjustment:** Comp #1 had $14,000 in seller concessions. Effective price adjusted to $1,386,000 for concession-adjusted metrics, but nominal $1,400,000 used in summary tables for consistency.
