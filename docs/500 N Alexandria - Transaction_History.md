## Price Appreciation

500 N Alexandria Avenue has demonstrated consistent value appreciation over the past decade. The property last traded in October 2017 for $800,000 ($114,286/unit) when Teddy Management LLC acquired it from Cho, Eric S. Prior to that, the property traded twice in rapid succession — $390,000 in 2012 and $550,000 in 2015 — reflecting the broader market recovery following the Great Recession and growing investor appetite for rent-controlled assets with upside.

Since the 2017 acquisition, the current ownership has added significant value through the construction of a legal ADU (Certificate of Occupancy issued July 2025), effectively increasing the unit count from 6 to 7 and adding approximately $22,500 in annual rental income. The existing financing — a $728,750 variable-rate loan from Bank of Hope originated in April 2021 — suggests the owner refinanced to fund improvements, positioning the property for its current market-rate potential.

The property's assessed value of $1,707,340 (2025) represents a 113% increase from the $800,000 acquisition price, reflecting both the ADU addition and assessed value growth. At the suggested list price of $1,275,000, the owner would realize approximately 59% appreciation over their 8.5-year hold period — a strong outcome for a rent-controlled asset.
