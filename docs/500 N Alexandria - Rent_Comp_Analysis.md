## Pro Forma Rent Narrative

The rent comp survey confirms meaningful upside for 500 N Alexandria's below-market units. Renovated 2-bedroom apartments in pre-war Koreatown buildings are consistently achieving $2,095 to $2,400 per month, with the median settling at $2,200 — the basis for our pro forma assumption on the RSO 2BR units (502 and 504). This represents a conservative approach, positioned at the center rather than the top of the comparable range.

Studios in the same vintage-building profile lease at $1,395 to $1,450 post-renovation, with the median at $1,425. The subject's ADU at $1,875 for 248 SF ($7.56/SF) is already at or near the market ceiling for micro-unit product. No additional rent lift is assumed for the ADU, reflecting a realistic assessment of the size constraint. The overall pro forma rent schedule of $13,925/month ($167,100/year) represents an 18.5% increase over current in-place rents — achievable through natural RSO turnover and a classic renovation scope of $18K–$25K per unit.

Confidence level is moderate-conservative. The pro forma rents are set at or slightly below the median comp range to account for the subject's smaller lot, limited parking, and absence of premium amenities like in-unit washer/dryers or central air. Vintage small buildings in this submarket are largely insulated from new Class A competition, which targets a different tenant demographic at a higher price point.
