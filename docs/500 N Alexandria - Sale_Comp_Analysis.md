## Market Narrative

The Koreatown-Mid Wilshire multifamily market has demonstrated resilience through the rate cycle. Three arm's-length closed sales within the past eight months provide a clear pricing framework for vintage RSO apartment buildings in the 90004 zip code. The anchor comparable — 101 S Kenmore Avenue, an 8-unit 1925-vintage building — traded at $199,375 per unit with a 7.29% adjusted cap rate, establishing the premium end of the market for well-maintained properties with reliable financial data.

Pricing dynamics reflect a market that rewards income quality. 212 S Berendo — with 8 deeply rent-controlled 2BR units and 108% rent upside — traded at a compressed 4.15% cap rate, demonstrating that buyers are willing to accept lower current yields when the embedded upside is substantial and clearly documented. In contrast, 247 N New Hampshire's off-market sale at $116,667/unit illustrates the discount applied to smaller units (studios) with unreliable financial data.

At $182,143 per unit, 500 N Alexandria is competitively positioned within the closed comp range. The subject's mixed unit types (2BR + studio + ADU), limited parking, and smaller building footprint justify a modest discount to the Kenmore benchmark, while the 2025 ADU, TOC Tier 3 overlay, and Opportunity Zone status provide upside optionality not available in any closed comp. The SP/LP ratio averaging 95% suggests list-to-close negotiation of approximately 3–5%.
