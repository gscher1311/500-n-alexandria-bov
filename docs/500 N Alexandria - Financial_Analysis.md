## Pricing Rationale

The suggested list price of $1,275,000 positions 500 N Alexandria as one of the most compelling value-add opportunities currently available in the Koreatown submarket. At $182,143 per unit and a 5.48% current cap rate, the pricing falls within the established range of comparable closed sales while offering a materially superior pro forma return of 7.42% upon full renovation and turnover — an outcome supported by 12 building-level and 16 unit-level rent comparables.

The pricing strategy balances seller optimization with buyer accessibility. At 55% LTV, a buyer can secure conventional financing at approximately 6.00% with a comfortable 1.38x debt service coverage ratio, generating positive cash flow from day one. The $573,750 equity requirement is accessible to the 1031 exchange investor pool that comprises 61% of LAAA Team's closed transactions, ensuring a deep bench of qualified buyers.

Three independent valuation methods — cap rate, price-per-unit, and gross rent multiplier — converge tightly around the $1,250,000–$1,300,000 range, providing high confidence in the suggested price. On-market competition is limited at this price point (every comparable listing exceeds $1,595,000), giving the subject a meaningful competitive advantage that should drive strong buyer interest and a compressed marketing timeline.
