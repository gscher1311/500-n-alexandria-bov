## Competitive Positioning

The active on-market inventory provides important context for the subject's competitive positioning. The pending sale at 502 N Serrano ($224,375/unit) validates buyer demand in the submarket at a higher price point, while fresh listings at 121 and 127 S Oxford ($200K–$225K/unit) will test the market's appetite for post-war 1BR product. Two stale listings — 426 N Virgil (133 DOM) and 4053 Oakwood (285 DOM) — have both reduced their asking prices, suggesting the market has a clear ceiling for aggressive pricing.

At $182,143 per unit, 500 N Alexandria is priced below every active and pending comparable in the submarket, creating an immediate competitive advantage. The most relevant on-market comparable — 310 N St Andrews Place, which also features 2025 ADUs — is asking $311,250/unit, nearly 70% higher than the subject. While St Andrews benefits from a more extensive renovation program, the pricing gap highlights the value proposition available at 500 N Alexandria for buyers seeking ADU exposure at an accessible price point.
