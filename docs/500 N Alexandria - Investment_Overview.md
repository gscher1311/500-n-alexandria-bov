## Property Summary

The LAAA Team is pleased to present for sale 500 N Alexandria Avenue, a 7-unit multifamily investment opportunity in the heart of Los Angeles' Koreatown-East Hollywood corridor. Situated on a quiet residential block between Rosewood Avenue and Clinton Street, the property comprises a well-maintained two-story front building (1923) and a rear accessory dwelling unit completed in 2025. The property offers immediate cash flow with significant embedded rent upside through tenant turnover.

The property features a diverse unit mix of four 2-bedroom/1-bathroom apartments, two studios, and one recently completed ADU — all 100% occupied. In-place rents range from $895 to $2,400 per month, with three units already at or near market levels and four rent-stabilized units offering substantial upside as tenants vacate naturally. The building benefits from recent capital improvements including a full electrical upgrade (400 amps, 6 panels) and the newly constructed ADU.

Zoned R3-1 with TOC Tier 3 overlay and located within a federally designated Opportunity Zone, 500 N Alexandria presents a compelling value-add opportunity. At a suggested list price of $1,275,000, the property delivers a current-year cap rate of 5.48% with a pro forma cap rate of 7.42% upon full renovation and turnover — offering investors attractive risk-adjusted returns with meaningful upside in one of LA's strongest rental markets.
