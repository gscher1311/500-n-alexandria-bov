## LOCATION GRADE: B

**Micro-Area:** Wilshire Center-Koreatown / East Hollywood border (Census Tract 1926.10 straddles both neighborhoods)

**Justification:** Strong transit access and walkability in a dense, renter-dominated urban neighborhood with moderate-to-low income demographics and active development activity.

**Key Positive Factors:**
- Walk Score ~85-86 ("Very Walkable"), Transit Score "Good" with Metro B Line (Red) Vermont/Beverly Station 0.6 miles away
- Dense urban infill area with strong rental demand and low vacancy; Wilshire Center-Koreatown is the 3rd most walkable neighborhood in LA (93 neighborhood Walk Score)
- Proximity to major employment corridors (Wilshire Blvd, Hollywood, DTLA), hospitals (Kaiser, Children's Hospital LA, Hollywood Presbyterian), and LA City College

**Key Negative Factors:**
- Below-average school ratings for surrounding LAUSD schools
- Moderate crime rates typical of dense urban Koreatown/East Hollywood corridor
- Census tract median household income (~$50K-$57K range) below LA city median ($80K)

**Comparable Nearby Areas:**
- Koreatown (core): B+ — Higher density, stronger retail, more development
- East Hollywood: B- — More transitional, less commercial amenity
- Larchmont Village: A- — Higher income, better schools, walkable village

**OM Location Paragraph:**
Situated in the heart of one of Los Angeles' most dynamic rental markets, 500 N Alexandria Ave benefits from its position at the intersection of Wilshire Center and East Hollywood, two of the city's most transit-rich and walkable neighborhoods. The property is just 0.6 miles from the Metro B Line (Red) Vermont/Beverly Station, providing direct subway access to Hollywood, Downtown LA, and North Hollywood. With a Walk Score in the mid-80s, residents enjoy easy pedestrian access to the diverse dining, retail, and entertainment options along Melrose Avenue, Vermont Avenue, and the Koreatown corridor. Major employers including Cedars-Sinai, Kaiser Permanente, Children's Hospital LA, and the studios in Hollywood are all within a short commute. The neighborhood continues to attract significant multifamily investment and development activity, with rising rents and strong absorption reflecting sustained demand for well-located housing in this centrally positioned pocket of Los Angeles.

## SECTION 1: Property Identity

| Field | Value | Source |

| Address | 500 N Alexandria Ave (also 500-510 1/2 N Alexandria Ave) | NiteOwlPro, CofO, permits |
| City | Los Angeles | NiteOwlPro |
| Zip Code | 90004 | NiteOwlPro |
| APN | 5520-009-026 | NiteOwlPro, CofO |
| Legal Description | Pioneer Investment and Trust Co's Windermere Park, W 40 ft of Lots 184 and Lot 185 | NiteOwlPro |
| Latitude/Longitude | 34.079304 / -118.297881 | NiteOwlPro |
| Census Tract | 1926.10 | CofO parcel info, ZIMAS |
| Council District | CD 13 (Hugo Soto-Martinez) | ZIMAS |
| Community Plan Area | Wilshire | CofO parcel info, ZIMAS |
| Area Planning Commission | Central APC | ZIMAS |
| Certified NC | Wilshire Center-Koreatown | CofO parcel info, ZIMAS |
| LADBS District Office | Los Angeles Metro | ZIMAS |

**Risks & Notes:**
- Property uses multiple addresses across units (500, 502, 504, 506, 508, 510). CofO references "508-510 1/2 N Alexandria Ave" for the ADU component. NiteOwlPro uses 500 N Alexandria Ave. Rent roll header uses "500 N Alexandria."
- ZIMAS lists property addresses as: 500, 502, 504, 506 N Alexandria Ave.
- ZIMAS case numbers: CPC-1986-823-GPC (AB283 zone consistency), CPC-1984-1-HD (height district change), ORD-165331-SA5870, ORD-161116-SA20, PRIOR-06/01/1946. All relate to area-wide zoning consistency programs, not property-specific entitlements.

## SECTION 2: Site & Land

| Field | Value | Source |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Lot Size (SF) | 4,558 SF (NiteOwlPro) / **2,558.8 SF (ZIMAS calculated)** | NiteOwlPro, ZIMAS |
| Lot Size (Acres) | 0.10 acres (NiteOwlPro) / 0.105 acres (ZIMAS APN Area) | NiteOwlPro, ZIMAS |
| Lot Dimensions | ~40' x ~114' (W 40 ft of Lots 184 & 185) | Legal description, 1924 plot plan |
| Lot Shape | Regular rectangular | Aerial/plot plan |
| Topography | Flat | Aerial |
| Corner Lot | No | Aerial/plot plan |
| Alley Access | Yes (rear alley per plot plans) | 1924 permit plot plan |
| Street Frontage | ~40 ft on N Alexandria Ave | Legal description |
| Lot Cut Date | 02/14/1913 (also PRIOR-06/01/1946) | CofO parcel info |

**Risks & Notes:**
- **CRITICAL LOT SIZE DISCREPANCY:** ZIMAS shows "Lot/Parcel Area (Calculated)" of 2,558.8 SF while NiteOwlPro reports 4,558 SF. The ZIMAS APN Area (Co. Public Works) shows 0.105 acres (~4,574 SF), which aligns with NiteOwlPro. The 2,558.8 SF ZIMAS "calculated" figure may represent only Lot 185 and not include the W 40 ft of Lot 184 portion of the legal description. **Recommend verifying with a lot book or title report.** For underwriting, the ~4,558 SF figure (consistent with APN acreage and legal description spanning two lots) is likely correct.
- Lot is relatively small at 4,558 SF for 7 units. Site density is very high.
- The legal description references "W 40 FT OF LOTS 184 AND LOT 185" spanning two original subdivision lots.

## SECTION 3: Improvements & Construction

| Field | Value | Source |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Year Built | 1923 (front building), 1929 (rear building) | 1924 permit (#17908 dated 4/11/1924), 1929 permit (#37390 dated 10/10/1929), NiteOwlPro |
| Year Renovated | 2021-2025 (ADU conversion) | Permits 21010-10000-04473, 21010-10001-04473 |
| Effective Age | ~70+ years (vintage construction with recent ADU) | Estimated |
| Building Class | C | Based on age, construction type |
| Stories | 2 (front), 1 (rear ADU) | Permits, plot plan |
| Building SF (GBA) | 4,360 SF (NiteOwlPro) / 3,440 SF + 920 SF = 4,360 SF (ZIMAS assessor) | NiteOwlPro, ZIMAS |
| Buildings on Site | 2 | NiteOwlPro, permits, ZIMAS |
| Construction Type | Wood frame (Type V-B) | CofO, all permits |
| Foundation | Continuous footing / concrete slab on grade (ADU) | Permits |
| Exterior | Stucco | 1966 permit |
| Roof Type | Composition (re-roofed 1993, Class A) | 1993 permit |
| Roof Age | ~33 years (last re-roof 1993) | 1993 permit |
| Elevator | No | Property type |
| ADU | 1 ADU (272 SF per CofO, ~248 SF per rent roll) | CofO #239092, rent roll |

**Risks & Notes:**
- Roof is 33 years old (1993 re-roof). Will likely need replacement in near term. Flag for capex.
- Two separate original construction permits: 1924 front building (4 rooms, 2 families) and 1929 rear building (6 rooms, 4 families). Property has evolved significantly from original configuration.
- ADU conversion completed 2025 with CofO issued 7/14/2025. ADU is 272 SF per CofO (storage conversion per LAMC 12.22 A.33).
- NiteOwlPro shows 4,360 SF living area. ZIMAS assessor data confirms: Building 1 (1923) = 3,440 SF, 4 units, 4BR/4BA, Class D6; Building 2 (1924 per ZIMAS, 1929 per original permit) = 920 SF, 2 units, 2BR/2BA, Class D6. Total = 4,360 SF. This does not include the ADU addition.
- **Note:** ZIMAS shows Building 2 year built as 1924, while the original permit (#37390) is dated 10/10/1929. The assessor date may be inaccurate.

## SECTION 4: Unit Mix & Interiors

| Unit | BD/BA | Tenant | Status | Sqft | Current Rent | Market Rent | Rent/SF | Notes |
|------|-------|--------|--------|------|-------------|-------------|---------|-------|
| 500 | 2/1 | Oscar Martinez | Current | — | $2,200 | $2,400 | — | Lease 10/16/25-10/15/26 |

| 510 | 0/1 | Barbaro Rivero | Current | 248 | $1,875 | $1,875 | $7.56 | Lease 4/15/25-4/14/26 (ADU) |
| **TOTAL** | **7 Units** | | **100% Occ** | **248** | **$11,553.40** | **$11,341.74** | | |

**Notes on Rent Roll:**
- Rent roll from AppFolio dated 2/11/2026
- "Market Rent" and "Rent" columns appear reversed in rent roll for RSO tenants (market rent shown lower than actual rent for units 502, 504, 508(1), 508(2)). This is unusual and may indicate data entry inconsistency in AppFolio. Verify with owner.
- 4 units show lease start date of "01/01/1970" which is a default/placeholder date indicating long-term RSO tenants
- Unit 510 is the newly created ADU (248 SF per rent roll, 272 SF per CofO)
- Total monthly rent: $11,553.40
- Total annual scheduled rent: $138,641

**Unit Mix Summary:**

| Type | Count | Avg Rent | Notes |
|------|-------|----------|-------|
| 2BR/1BA | 4 | $1,822 | Range: $1,290-$2,200 |
| Studio/0BR | 3 | $1,421 | Range: $895-$1,875 |
| **Total** | **7** | **$1,650** | |

## SECTION 5: Amenities & Common Areas

| Amenity | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| On-site Laundry | Unknown | Verify with owner |
| Pool | No | Per property type/lot size |
| Courtyard/Common Area | Likely minimal | Small lot (4,558 SF) |
| Security (gates, cameras) | Unknown | Verify |
| Controlled Access | Unknown | Verify |
| Storage Units | Converted to ADU | Former storage now Unit 510 |
| Garage - Private | Yes | Per CofO (attached to duplex building) |

---

## SECTION 6: Parking

| Field | Value | Source |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Total Spaces | Unknown - Verify | |
| Garage Spaces | At least 1 (private garage per CofO) | CofO |
| Parking Required (CofO) | 0 stalls required for ADU | CofO structural inventory |
| Parking Ratio | Likely <1.0/unit | Typical for vintage K-town |

**Risks & Notes:**
- CofO shows "Parking Req'd for Bldg (Auto+Bicycle): 0 Stalls" for the ADU permit. This is consistent with CA ADU law eliminating parking requirements for ADUs within 1/2 mile of transit.
- ZIMAS confirms AB 2097 eligibility (within 1/2 mile of Major Transit Stop), which eliminates minimum parking requirements for new development.
- Total property parking needs verification. 1993 permit showed present use as "05 APT" with no parking detail.
- Low parking is typical for pre-war buildings in this area and generally acceptable given strong transit access.

## SECTION 7: Building Systems & Condition

| System | Type/Age | Condition | Notes |
|--------|----------|-----------|-------|
| Roof | Comp shingle, 1993 re-roof | Aged (33 yrs) | Class A per 1993 permit. Budget for replacement. |
| Plumbing | Unknown | Unknown | Original 1923/1929. Verify if repiped. |
| Electrical | ADU: 400 amps, 6 panels, 6 disconnects (2024) / Original buildings: Unknown | ADU portion upgraded | LADBS permits 2024. Verify original building panel capacity, wiring type |
| HVAC | Unknown | Unknown | Likely wall heaters |
| Water Heaters | Unknown | Unknown | Verify |
| Fire Sprinklers | Unlikely | — | Pre-war low-rise, typically exempt |
| Sewer | Unknown | Unknown | 100+ yr old sewer laterals possible |
| Windows | Unknown | Unknown | 1966 permit was for window replacement |

**Risks & Notes:**
- Building systems data is very limited from uploaded documents. Major gap for BOV/underwriting.
- 1923/1929 vintage means potential for original galvanized plumbing, knob-and-tube wiring, and other deferred maintenance items.
- Window replacement permit from 1966 may mean windows are now 60 years old.

| Promise Zone | Los Angeles | ZIMAS |
| State Enterprise Zone | Los Angeles | ZIMAS |
| Housing Element Site | Yes (HE Replacement Required, SB 166 Rezoning Sites: 1) | ZIMAS |

**R3-1 Zoning Summary:**
- Permits multiple dwelling units
- Density: 1 unit per 800 SF of lot area (by-right)
- By-right max: 4,558 / 800 = **5 units by-right** (currently 7 units on site)
- The property is over-dense relative to current zoning by-right, which is common for pre-war buildings. Existing 7 units are legal nonconforming.
- Height limit: 45 ft / 3 stories in Height District 1

**Zoning Overlays (ZIMAS):**
- ZI-2543: Transfer of Authority for Zoning Review
- ZI-2452: Transit Priority Area in the City of Los Angeles
- ZI-2427: Freeway Adjacent Advisory Notice for Sensitive Uses
- ZI-2512: Housing Element Sites
- ZI-2374: State Enterprise Zone: Los Angeles

**TOC/MIIP Analysis:**
- TOC Tier 3 provides significant density bonus and incentive options for qualifying affordable housing projects
- TOIA Tier 2 under the Mixed Income Incentive Program (MIIP) offers additional development incentives
- AB 2097 eligibility (within 1/2 mile of Major Transit Stop) eliminates minimum parking requirements for new development
- These overlays significantly enhance redevelopment potential if the site were ever entitled for new construction

**Density Calculations:**

| Scenario | Max Units | Basis |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| By-Right (R3-1) | 5 | 4,558 SF / 800 SF per unit |
| Existing | 7 (including ADU) | Legal nonconforming + ADU |
| With Additional ADU | Potentially 8+ | State ADU law |

| Ellis Act History | **No** | ZIMAS, NiteOwlPro |
| JCO (Just Cause for Eviction) | **No** | ZIMAS |
| Housing Crisis Act Replacement Review | **Yes** | ZIMAS |

**RSO Notes:**
- 4 of 7 units appear to be long-term RSO tenants (units 502, 504, 508(1), 508(2)) based on the 1/1/1970 placeholder dates
- 3 units appear to be at or near market rent (500, 506, 510/ADU)
- ADU (Unit 510) is likely exempt from RSO as new construction post-2007, subject to AB 1482 instead
- Recent RSO formula change (effective 7/1/2026): max increase drops from 8% ceiling to 4% ceiling. Significant impact on long-term rent growth projections for RSO units.

### Building Code Compliance:

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Soft-Story Retrofit | **Not Required** | LADBS: "Possible Soft-Story: NO" |

## SECTION 10: Permit History

| Permit # | Type | Description | Date | Status | Value |
|----------|------|-------------|------|--------|-------|
| 17908 | New Construction | Original 4-room dwelling, 2 families | 4/11/1924 | Completed | $4,500 |
| 37390 | New Construction | Rear flat, 6 rooms, 4 families | 10/10/1929 | Completed | $1,000+ |
| (1966) | Alter/Repair | Window replacement, non-structural | 8/30/1966 | Completed | $600 |
| 40030353 | Alter/Repair | Re-roof with Class A, 37 sq | 8/17/1993 | Completed | $4,400 |
| 21010-10000-04473 | Building | ADU conversion (storage to dwelling) per LAMC 12.22 A.33 | 2021 | CofO Issued 7/14/2025 | — |
| 21010-10001-04473 | Building | Supplemental to ADU permit (design change) | 4/5/2023 | Issued | $50,000 |
| 24041-40000-01909 | Electrical | Install electric panel for 2 ADUs, 292 amps total connected load | 1/12/2024 | Issued | — |
| 24041-20001-01909 | Electrical | Supplemental: addition of 3 panels and 3 disconnects, 292 amps | 9/4/2024 | Issued | — |
| 24041-30002-01909 | Electrical | Supplemental: change to 6 disconnects and 6 panels, 400 amps total | 10/8/2024 | Issued | — |

**Key Permits to Flag:**
- ADU conversion completed 2025: Storage area converted to 272 SF ADU. CofO issued. This is a positive for the property, adding a legal income-producing unit.
- Supplemental permit ($50K valuation) suggests meaningful investment in ADU buildout.
- **Electrical upgrades (2024):** Three electrical permits issued in 2024 for ADU panel installation. Final scope: 6 panels, 6 disconnects, 400 amps total connected load. Reference to "2 ADUs" in the first permit is notable and may indicate a second ADU was contemplated or permitted. Verify with owner.
- **Soft-story retrofit: NOT REQUIRED** per LADBS. Property not flagged as possible soft-story. This eliminates a significant capex risk.
- **Zero code enforcement cases** on file at LADBS. Clean compliance history.
- No repipe or major electrical upgrade permits found for the original buildings. 100-year-old plumbing/electrical remains a risk for the non-ADU portion.

**Transaction History Summary:**
- Teddy Management LLC acquired for $800K in Oct 2017 (~$114K/unit at 7 units)
- Refinanced with Bank of Hope for $728,750 in April 2021 (variable rate commercial loan)
- Prior ownership: Cho family / Kim family with multiple intra-family transfers dating back to at least 2001
- Property was previously assessed as "Apartment house (5+ units)" in assessor records

**Risks & Notes:**
- Assessed value of $1.7M vs $800K purchase price indicates significant reassessment, likely due to the post-purchase refi and/or improvements.
- The $728,750 loan is a variable rate commercial loan from Bank of Hope. In current rate environment, debt service may be elevated.

## SECTION 18: Value-Add & Risk Analysis

### Value-Add Opportunities:

| Opportunity | Current | Potential | Investment | Notes |
|-------------|---------|-----------|------------|-------|
| Rent Upside (RSO turnover) | 4 RSO units at $895-$1,599 | $1,800-$2,200 at turnover | Renovation cost | 50-100%+ rent lift on RSO unit turnover |
| Interior Renovation (at turnover) | Unknown condition | Classic rehab: $18-22K/unit | $18-22K/unit | Depends on unit condition |
| RUBS Implementation | Unknown | $50-100/unit/mo | Minimal | Verify current utility structure |
| Laundry Income | Unknown | $200-400/mo | $15-25K install | If not currently on site |
| Parking Monetization | Unknown | $50-150/space/mo | Minimal | If unassigned spaces exist |

**Rent Upside Analysis:**
- Unit 502 (Maria Aguilar): $1,289.74 current → ~$2,200 market = **$910/mo upside (71%)** at turnover
- Unit 504 (Flores Feliciano): $1,599.33 current → ~$2,200 market = **$601/mo upside (38%)** at turnover
- Unit 508(1) (Sheyanne Phillips): $1,494.32 current → ~$1,800+ market = **$306/mo upside (20%+)** at turnover
- Unit 508(2) (Emy Almendarez): $895.01 current → ~$1,500+ market = **$605/mo upside (68%)** at turnover
- **Total monthly rent upside at full turnover: ~$2,422/mo ($29,064/yr)**
- Long-term RSO tenants (1/1/1970 dates) suggest these are elderly or very long-tenured. Natural turnover timeline is uncertain.

### Risk Factors:

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| Rent Control Exposure | **High** | 4 of 7 units RSO-controlled; new formula caps at 4% max. Value heavily dependent on turnover timing. |
| Seismic Risk | **Low-Medium** | 1923/1929 wood frame. **Soft-story retrofit NOT required per LADBS.** Not in Alquist-Priolo zone, no liquefaction. Nearest fault 1.92 km (blind thrust). |
| Deferred Maintenance | **High** | 100+ year old building systems. No repipe, electrical upgrade, or major capex permits on record. Roof is 33 years old. |
| Tenant Quality | Low-Medium | Long-term tenants (stability), but RSO limits upside. |
| Environmental | Low | Flat urban site, no obvious contamination indicators. |
| Regulatory | **High** | LA RSO formula overhaul (Dec 2025) significantly limits annual rent growth. Utility adders eliminated. |
| Market/Vacancy | Low | 100% occupied; strong renter demand area. |

## DEAL TYPE & THESIS

**Deal Type:** Value-Add (Light) + RSO Turnover Play

### INVESTMENT THESIS

**One-Line Hook:**
> "100% Occupied 7-Unit Koreatown Asset with Permitted ADU, 71% Rent Upside on Legacy RSO Tenants, and Strong Transit Access"

**Why This Asset Wins:**
1. **Newly Permitted ADU (2025 CofO):** Recent storage-to-ADU conversion adds a legal market-rate unit, increasing density and income without new construction risk
2. **Significant RSO Rent Upside:** 4 legacy RSO units averaging $1,320/mo vs. ~$2,000+ market = ~$2,400/mo ($29K/yr) of embedded upside upon natural turnover
3. **Prime Transit Location:** 0.6 miles from Metro B Line (Red) in one of LA's highest-demand renter markets with Walk Score ~85

**Target Buyer Profile:**
- **1031 Investor:** Predictable income stream with embedded upside; seasoned LA investor comfortable with RSO
- **Local Operator/Value-Add Buyer:** Can renovate units at turnover and capture significant rent lift; hands-on management adds value
- **Multi-Property Owner in K-town/E. Hollywood:** Portfolio consolidation play; familiar with submarket dynamics and tenant base

## COMPARABLE POSITION ANALYSIS

| Metric | Subject | Typical K-town 5-10 Unit |
|--------|---------|--------------------------|
| Year Built | 1923/1929 | 1920s-1960s |
| Units | 7 | 5-10 |
| Lot Size | 4,558 SF | 5,000-8,000 SF |
| Monthly Income | $11,553 | Varies |
| Price/Unit (2017 basis) | $114K/unit | $150-250K/unit current |
| RSO Status | Subject | Mostly subject |
| ADU | 1 (recently permitted) | Rare for vintage |

**Notes:**
- The 2017 purchase at $800K ($114K/unit) was well below today's market. Current value significantly higher.
- The permitted ADU is a differentiator among vintage small multifamily in this submarket.
- Need CoStar/MLS comps for current market pricing (access restricted).
